# Port Scanner
A port scanner is a software tool used to scan a computer or network for open network ports. Ports are endpoints through which data enters or exits a computer or device, and they are associated with specific services and applications. Port scanning is a critical component of network security and system administration for the following reasons:

<li>Identifying Open Ports: Port scanners are used to determine which network ports are open and listening for incoming connections. Open ports can represent potential security vulnerabilities.

<li>Security Assessment: By scanning for open ports, security professionals can assess the security posture of a network or system and identify potential weaknesses that need to be addressed.

<li>Firewall Configuration: Port scanners can help administrators verify that their firewall rules are properly configured to allow or block specific types of traffic.

<li>Network Mapping: Port scans can be used to create network maps that show which services are running on which devices, helping with network management and troubleshooting.

<li>Intrusion Detection: Port scanning can be an indicator of malicious activity or unauthorized attempts to access a network. Intrusion detection systems often use port scanning as a signature of an attack.
